### Ranged Attack

Uses the appropriate spell to attack with your equipped ranged weapon.

```
/cast [equipped:Bow] Shoot Bow; [equipped:Crossbow] Shoot Crossbow; [equipped:Gun] Shoot Gun; [equipped:Thrown] Throw;
/startattack
```

### Weapon Swap

Switches between two sets of weapons.

```
#showtooltip 16
/equipslot 16 <MAIN>
/equipslot 17 <OFF>
/equipslot 16 <2H>
```

```
#showtooltip 16
/equipslot 16 <MAIN #1>
/equipslot 17 <OFF #1>
/equipslot 16 <MAIN #2>
/equipslot 17 <OFF #2>
```

### Mouseover Use Helm

Use your equipped helm on your target or mouseover target. Prioritizes the mouseover target. Nice for Goblin Rocket Helmet.

```
#showtooltip 1
/use [@mouseover, harm, nodead][] 1
```

### Toggle Cleave

Turn Cleave on or off for the next main-hand swing.

```
#show Cleave
/cast Cleave
/startattack
/stopcasting
```

### Toggle Heroic Strike

Turn Heroic Strike on or off for the next main-hand swing.

```
#show Heroic Strike
/cast Heroic Strike
/startattack
/stopcasting
```

### Mouseover Interrupt

Casts Pummel on the target or mouseover target if you are in Berserker Stance. If a shield is not equipped, casts Berserker Stance. Otherwise, casts Shield Bash instead. Prioritizes the mouseover target.

```
#showtooltip
/stopcasting
/use [@mouseover, harm, nodead, stance:3][stance:3] Pummel; [noequipped:Shields] Berserker Stance; [@mouseover, harm, nodead][] Shield Bash
/startattack
```

### Mouseover Intimidating Shout

Use your Intimidating Shout on your target or mouseover target. Prioritizes the mouseover target. This is useful if there is a target close to your main target so you can catch your main target in a fear that will not break on damage. For example, you can mouseover a shaman totem near a shaman so the shaman is caught in a fear for 8 seconds and you can DPS them the whole time.
